She impresses upon them the horrible nature of her [Page 50] moral depravity, and then orders them to have the ceremony of purification (of the girl, her lover and the community) performed, and this takes place outside the queen-mother's palace. In Offinso and some other chiefdoms, the girl is, in the first instance, taken to the paramount chief; and if the identity of the lover is known, he too is ordered to appear at the chief's house. The boy and girl are compelled to pay a certain amount of money 6 which their parents provide, if only because in the eyes of the people, the parents bear the blame of the offence equally with their children, as it demonstrates the inadequacy of the parental education they received. With the money, the spokesman of the chief purchases a sheep or two, a bottle of palm-oil, a small white chick (preferably just hatched), a pot of water and eggs. Then prayers are said to pacify the spiritual beings so outrageously offended. An old woman is selected to shave the recalcitrant girl, after which the leaf of a plant called damram, which is very red in colour is shown to the girl with the words: S akwadaa rep ade k[unavailable]k[unavailable][unavailable] ahw a yde damram ahahan kyer no. If a child insists on seeing something red, it is shown the leaf of damram. Red is symbolic of danger, 7 and so it is bad for a child to want to behold it. This common saying therefore is tantamount to a curse to the effect that a bad child (in this case, the girl) who only does dangerous and forbidden things, should be prepared for the consequences of its action.

According to one informant, for the purification to be effective at all, blood should run down the girl's genitals. Otherwise the ceremony would be considered unsuccessful and another sheep would have to be killed.

They took innumerable precautions to remove the body and destroy the ghost, to prevent the latter from causing further trouble. Shame for crime committed led to suicide, but this occurred rarely in any section of the community, and most rarely among women. When a man committed suicide, he hanged himself on a tree in his garden or in his house. In the former case the body was cut down, and the tree felled also; then both the tree and the corpse, the latter tied to a pole like the carcase of an animal, were taken to a distant place [p. 21] where cross-roads met, and the body was burned, the tree being used for the firewood. In the latter case the house was pulled down, and the materials were taken with the body and burned in the road. People feared to live in a house in which a suicide had taken place, lest they too should be tempted to commit the same crime. Those who burned the corpse washed their hands carefully at the place of burning with sponges made from the plantains, and threw them on the pyre. When women passed the place where a suicide had been burned, they threw grass or sticks upon the heap, to prevent the ghost from entering into them and being reborn. The idea in burning the body was if possible to destroy the ghost. (pg. 289) A suicide's body was burnt on waste land by the roadside, or at cross-roads, in order to destroy the ghost. If the suicide had not been a person of any consequence and his relatives did not claim his body, it was burnt to dust; if, however, he had been a person of some position, and his relatives claimed the body, it was first charred by fire before it was handed over to them. If the deed had been committed in a house, the house was also burnt; and if he had hanged himself on a tree, the tree was torn up by its roots and burnt with the body. In this way the ghost was thought to be destroyed, so that it could not tempt any other person to commit suicide. Everyone passing the spot where the body of a suicide had been burned took the precaution to throw some grass, or a few sticks, on the place, so as to prevent the ghost from catching him, in case it had not been destroyed.","accus_commit_wrongdo,spirit_attack"41,calsbeek,Cultural model,Hausa,"Informants related that in pre-British days, complete deadlock between a girl and her parents concerning the choice of a husband for her first marriage was very rare, but if it occurred was resolved by the girl's throwing herself down a well--the only instances of suicide which were encountered, despite continual enquiry.","forced marriage,family tension"45,calsbeek,Case,Kanuri,"Other informants tell stories of men demeaning themselves because of their emotional involvement with a particular woman.

In one such story, the man finally went to the Emir and said he was going to commit suicide (an almost unheard of thing in Bornu) unless he could get his wife to return.

There was a fairly even balance between the sexes, 15 males and 12 females. Possibly, the high proportion of females may be taken to mean that mest accusations were of practising black rather than white magic.

And, in fact, in spite of the juridical capacity which not only the law but the mores recognize for her, and which her psychological propensity makes her exercise fully, her life in certain respects is more amenable to an extrajuridical plane than that of the man. Perhaps because of lesser communal implication: economy of the gift during the long betrothal, assiduous practice of magic, relationships offides in the marriage state, recognized aptitude for imprecatory procedures. It is in these perspectives that it is necessary to study the act, rich in social consequences, that the suicide of the woman constitutes, an act relatively frequent, and which manifests the rupture, voluntary or not, of the bond of the group.

'He and his wife often quarrelled because they had very bad sons. From quarrelling with his wife came his desire to be killed. One day his elder son and his mother picked a quarrel with him. Then he asked to be killed.'.... [p. 565-567] ""Another story refers to a desire for voluntary death once expressed and then revoked. The story is as follows:--'My neighbor in the camp, Little-Spoon by name, also asked to be killed. With many words he persuaded his house-mates. Before that, he had quarrelled with his wife. They had very bad sons. His sons and their mother quarrelled with their father. For that reason he was angered. Therefore he asked to be killed. They had only one driving-reindeer, almost no other reindeer. The other sons slaughtered a woman's driving-reindeer led by the halter (i.e., very well broken), because he had many more sons. But the oldest son quarrelled with him. Therefore it was necessary to kill a reindeer-buck for his last meal. We thought he was really asking to be killed. We made haste and prepared everything necessary. We replaced the broken and mended parts of the sledges with new ones, for our people consider a repaired sledge not fit for use in death. If something broken and repaired breaks again on the trail of the dead, what would he (the dead one) do? The dog people live halfway; and when the one who died reaches them, the dead come to meet him. They know that he is coming, and say, ""He will lose his way."" They are aware of his helplessness, because there are many paths, all leading to the relatives among the dead. For that reason the reindeer and the clothes of other people must not be used. The dead people going to and fro in their own country move windward, and catch the smell, saying, ""These clothes have an odor of our home."" Then they take them away. Therefore nothing belonging to other men must be used. Poor men will use only suits of clothes of their own. New clothes, taken from others, or received as a gift, are put aside. Things very bad, but one's own, are put into use. I must say the truth, the dead people are very bad people. They would not say, ""Leave him alone!"".... Meanwhile, whence do the living people know all about it? To be sure, many of our people come back from the trail of the dead. Probably they have made known the customs of the country of the dead. Many dead ones are turned back by the power of incantations. Even I, when I was rich, received several such incantations from hungry old women, gratifying their stomach with food. But I am sorry to say that at present I have lost those incantations, being so poor. A man going along the trail of the dead may be turned back by a dog. The shaman bites the left ear of the dog, and says to it, ""Go and bring back thy master. We will feed thee with the best food."" (He may also be brought back with an incantation.) One with a slight disease may be turned back where the trailis barred by a dog, which, springing at his face, makes him come back. One with a serious disease would not yield. When a man coming back from the dead has turned back, the dog is killed. The Reindeer people keep dogs because they are very strong in bringing back those dying ones. Is there any other use for them? We have to feed them. I cannot deny, however, that the dog is good for many other uses. In hunting big game, he has a loud voice, that is a useful protection against a bear met unexpectedly in the dark. You know it yourself,--everybody has a dog, many of the people have dogs. When we travelled with you, nobody was without a dog. In connection with this, when a man goes along the trail of the dead, it is useless to take a reindeer for an incantation. The reindeer is full of fear. It runs from afar and exerts no influence; it is only visible to eyes. To be sure, it appears (on the trail), but only from afar. And when a man is quite dead and has ceased breathing, those who are living do not weep for him,--those looking (upon the world) members of his family. They do not weep shortly after he is dead. Weeping is sinful. The one who has a slight disease is rejected by the dead. They say, ""Why did you come? Go away, go home."" Then he goes away, returns home. It appears in various ways. One may breathe, but he will lost his wits. In this case he probably has an hallucination. He says, ""I have come back from the dead."" Some people eat fly-agaric. Those from the Anadyr bring fly-agaric. Before eating, they say to it, ""Take me to the dead;"" and indeed, they are taken there. He sinks down, falls into a swoon, and then he is taken away,--not his body, but only his soul. And some one who has a hidden disease may stay there forever. Therefore what has been said about the taking-away of clothes must have become known through those who eat fly-agaric. Indeed, from three sources it may become known, --from those who are turned back by dogs, from those sent back by the Merciful Being because the dead have rejected them (these first two bring tidings), and from those who eat fly-agaric. Little-Spoon, however, unexpectedly stopped his preparations, although before it seemed that he had made up his mind. We had made all the necessary preparations, and were gathering our sledges and the other things required; but we were disappointed, for evening came, and we were still waiting in vain. Finally we could not wait any longer, and stopped our preparations. Evening came, night came. We were speechless. He had only gorged himself. He had eaten the best and sweetest morsels. I questioned his sons, and said to them, ""Well, what is he doing?"" They replied, ""We will begin after he has eaten."" Then they said, ""He has gone to sleep."" The sledge remained behind the tent all night, as though in readiness for one really dead. The following morning, when he awoke, he would not come out of the sleeping-room. He remained there all the time. Among us reindeer-breeders it is a great sin to talk about voluntary death without executing one's intentions: therefore the next fall three of his sons died. Thus he brought a great misfortune upon himself by talking about voluntary death. I sent him away, saying, ""Do not stay here. We might become unlucky; we might lose our reindeer or have other misfortunes."" Therefore we separated. Another year he died on the western tundra. And I say once more, when somebody speaks about voluntary death, the Outer Being hears his words. Should he say ever so little about it, he has to buy it off with heavy ransom. When his house-mates induce him to retract his intented [sic] promise, he gives away whatever is nearest to his heart. He gives it in ransom to the Outer Being, on account of a single word about voluntary death, saying, ""This is my body, I have spoken foolishly."" He gives as a sacrifice, on account of his word, something that he values most. This is because many who are sick ask for death and then recover, or are restrained by words of their friends and do not go away.","interpersonal_confli,family tension,emotional distress"98,calsbeek,Case,Chukchee,"Ai'gInto said, 'Oh! they (the kelet [JMR: harmful spirits]) have stolen my son.

If a controversy between near kinsmen from their respective families arises, the spouses may try for peace, but, if the affair becomes bitter, each will adhere to his own family, and the marriage will dissolve. [p. 100] If distant kinsmen be at controversy, the spouses may temporize and evade a stand, and bring the matrimonial bark safely through. But if they want an excuse for a divorce, such an occasion offers it. While the marriage lasts, each spouse is considered a member of the family of the other, functions as such, and is often able to command, in time of need, the aid of the other's brothers, possibly sisters' husbands, and even cousins. This is especially probable if the marriage has been blessed with children. Nothing else so strengthens the alliance. An instance will show. In the next house but one to mine there in the village, lived a youth, Soft Stone. Although of poor stock and from a remote region, he was married to a girl of rather uppish family. He had been able to hawk above his station because of the fact that at the time of his marriage he was working as a stonecutter (having learned that trade through working on the school building) and earning forty cents a day. But the demand for his trade had ceased, and he would work at nothing else. This couple had a baby boy. Next door to them lived Persimmon, a soldier in the Philippine Constabulary, and his wife, Cicada (or, as we might translate, Seventeen-Year-Locust). The two were incompatible. I remember the names because of their suggestion of the dominant traits of the individuals and of the [p. 101] sources of the domestic friction. A situation already bad was complicated further by the fact that Cicada's mother, from whom the girl inherited her signal characteristic, was a third member of the household. One day Persimmon suggested a divorce. For once, Cicada agreed with him--too quickly, indeed. Then she lapsed into silence and thought--both unusual. Between her vocal cords and her mind there seems to have existed the same relation as between the whistle and the engine of a traditional Mississippi tug-boat: when either worked it required all the steam, and the other had to quit. Viewing her thus silent, and contemplating her curves, almost none of which were concealed by clothing, Persimmon found her as irresistibly attractive to the eye as she was usually irritating to the ear. He repented of his suggestion--that was his first mistake. Cicada was thinking about alimony. (It has often been observed that primitive folk take most heartily to the doubtful importations civilization brings.) A new company commander had been allowing alimony to divorcees of soldiers. Cicada went straightway to the C.O., who, over Persimmon's protest that he still wanted her, granted a divorce with alimony until such time as she should again become a bride--which, she declared, would be never! Persimmon took her at her word, and the prospect [p. 102] appalled him. A second mistake, perhaps, although he might be presumed to know better than anybody else of what her malice was capable. And he could hardly be optimistic, since she was his fourth wife to turn out disappointingly. Persimmon's comrades in arms noted a change in him immediately after the next pay day and later testified they had had an inkling of tragic possibilities. He would whet his mess kit knife for hours at a time. When they asked him why he was so preoccupied thus, he answered, ""Oh, some day we'll kill a fat hog for the company, and I'll be the one to cut it up."" He presented the characteristic symptoms of a Malay generating that form of brainstorm that has enriched our language with the word ""amok."" One night Persimmon went to his former home and called on Cicada and her mother. He sat down in the door-way and talked for a few moments with disarming friendliness. Then he called to Soft Stone in the next house, inviting him over. ""Soft Stone,"" he said, ""when are you going to pay me that three pesos and a half you borrowed for a month--more than a year ago?"" ""Oh!"" said Soft Stone, ""I know that I have been a little slow, but after next harvest I will go to the lowlands to work for the government on bridges, and then I'll repay you."" [p. 103] Quicker than a snake strikes, Persimmon stabbed the youth deeply in the abdomen. Before Cicada could jump out of the back door, only six feet away, he had caught her and stabbed her twice through the left breast. He turned to murder his mother-in-law, but she had escaped. Possibly he had been looking forward too fondly to that dnouement and could not brook his disappointment. At any rate, he did a most un-Ifugao-like thing: he attempted suicide, stabbing himself deep into the liver several times. Himself he could not kill--though he made an honest effort--and was the only one of the three to survive. It was the only instance of suicidal attempt I heard of during my years in Ifugaoland. Thus Persimmon. He did not suspect Soft Stone of alienating his wife's affections--it was simply that he loved life less than he hated the parasitism of women. And, while punishing that, he thought well to punish also the parasitism of ""I'll-pay-you-pretty-soon."" Soft Stone's wife had been christianized. She called the missionary, who, while I was bandaging the wounds inflicted on her husband, baptized him and made him a christian--a thing about which poor Soft Stone had no say, since he was unconscious during the whole process. Indeed the padre finished just in time. Soft Stone was buried in holy ground next day. [p. 104] Cicada died two days later. Her body was set under the eaves of her house, a knife in one hand, a spear in the other. Just as her mother and female kin had begun to shout incitations to her soul not to let death interrupt her harrying of Persimmon, there arrived a delegation from Palao, six miles away. The foremost member, a woman, went directly to the grief-stricken mother and began cuffing her, saying, ""Curse you, Sister-in-law! This is what comes of your meddling. You egged them to it!"" I asked a bystander why the woman from Palao acted so. ""Because she is Cicada's father,"" was the answer. Further questioning elicited the fact that she was the eldest sister of Cicada's deceased father and was the ""center"" of his family group. However much she blamed the sister-in-law for the tragedy, she soon allied herself with her in the incitations to Cicada's soul. Ifugaos reckon relationship by generations. All terms except those for ""father"" and ""mother"" (and a few that are rarely used) are common in gender. An individual is sibling (brother or sister) to all his kin of the same generation, child (son or daughter) of all his kin of the preceding generation, grandchild of all generations before that. He is father or mother to the generation succeeding his own and grandparent to all that follow. How little important is sex even in the distinction made as to parents is shown by the [p 105] fact that the father's sisters are usually called ""mothers,"" but at his death, the eldest sibling, whether male or female, steps into his place and becomes known as the ""father."" If it be desired to be specific in the case of a term common in regard to sex, the words ""male"" or ""female"" are appended, as ""male grandparent."" And now comes the illustrativeness for which I have inserted this bit of the history of my home village. Although we have seen Soft Stone given respectable Christian burial, we are not through with him. Soft Stone's wife had also a female father, who had taken her to rear after the death of her parents--shall we say, ""of the first instance?"" This female father was the wife of the American-appointed ""president"" of Kurug, a region a good half-day's hike distant. She and her husband were a devoted couple and always did what in her opinion was right. When they heard of the stabbing of her son-in-law, they came immediately, only to find him buried already and in an outlandish manner. Great was the wrath of the female father and consequently of her husband, who, I suppose, was a father of the third instance. ""Soft Stone,"" they said, ""is not of our blood, and it would not matter to us if they used him for hog feed except that he has a child by our daughter. That quite changes [p. 106] the matter. He is going to be buried according to good custom and with all the correct vengeance ceremonies, that his son, a member of our family, be not disgraced forever and we shamed along with him.""

A day or so later when she had calmed down, a group of neighbors visited her to ask that more consideration be given to the children. It was also pointed out that a repetition of such acts would probably bring a police investigation. Despite the exceptional and scandalous nature of these cases as well as the intensity of the animosity that was generated, none of the persons involved considered leaving the village or even renouncing his family ties. In both cases neighbors and kinsmen intervened in an attempt to promote some sort of acceptable settlement.

In 1964 and 1965 he had been living in Seoul, where he dealt illegally and profitably in cosmetics. During that time he acquired both a wife and a concubine and maintained two houses. This style of living combined with a disastrous police raid forced his return to S[unknown] okp'o with the two women as a penniless dependent of his parents. His relatives and wife were anxious to get rid of the concubine, who was pregnant, but the son was adamant and they all continued to live together. The wife's account of this story was somewhat ambivalent; at one point she boasted of her husband's prowess in attracting and satisfying two young women, and then complained that the situation was unbearable. [p. 211] At any rate, things deteriorated to a point where she attempted suicide in protest, and the concubine was eventually moved out of the house with her baby to a room in a different neighborhood. Then while the son was away on an extended fishing trip, his mother and wife simply refused to give the girl any food and she was forced to go back to Seoul. When the husband returned, there was a big family quarrel with lots of noise and he beat his wife, but the situation had finally been resolved to the relief of kin and neighbors. The weakness of the concubine's position, which depended entirely on the personal support of her lover, is readily apparent. Since the wife had provided a son, there was no justification at all for the woman's presence in the village. Still, if the husband had been able to provide more generous material support, he probably could have maintained his polygynous household, at least for a time. While the impulsive and tyrannical behavior of this eldest son was tolerated temporarily, without wealth he was unable to have his way in the face of the united opposition of parents, wife, and village opinion.","interpersonal_confli,disappointment in ma,family tension,bring in cowife"135,calsbeek,Case,Korea,"Shamans play a significant role in folk religion. When a family has suffered continuously from various misfortunes, it is common to consult a shaman, because illness and misfortunes are often viewed as the result by angers of spirits who govern functionings of human daily life. A shaman usually recommends that the wife of the household perform a shamanic casting away ceremony in order to relieve the anger of bad spirits. The date of the performance is set for one of the ""clean"" days according to the [p. 191] lunar calendar.7 ) On the day of the ceremony, the wife of a household cleans the whole house. The ceremony starts at dinner time before the sunset and lasts until one or two o'clock in the morning. The most important items of food offered to the various spirits which govern all aspects of human life are rice, raw and cooked, vegetables, dried fish and pork. Rice especially symbolizes the wealth of the family. It is constantly offered on the temporary altar arranged in the main living room of the house. The shaman who is invited to this ceremony (kut) sets the table for all the spirits including the ancestral spirits. After the table is set, she starts singing, inviting the spirits to the feast offered by the wife of the household. Next, she tries to talk personally with each ancestral spirit related to the wife of the household. In this case, ancestors who died outside their home or women who died without a surviving son, receive the most attention because unhappy ancestors might be the cause of the bad luck of the household. One ceremony that was performed in 1977 was carried out in order to help the wife of the household who constantly suffered from economic and family problems. She was once the mistress of the present husband, and later became a legal wife to him after his former wife committed suicide. The recent troubles that she suffered brought back all her old guilt feelings. She had been worried about the stained relationship with her husband and step sons. The shaman in charge of that ceremony invoked her family problems in public in the presence of her husband and her step sons. The troubled wife acknowledged her fault in public, asked the dead former wife of her husband to forgive her fault and promised to offer the ancestor worship ceremony to the spirit of the dead former wife of her husband sincerely. the wife of the household carried on that shamanic performance and invited as many guests as possible because it is generally thought that the more people participate in the ceremony the more benefit the sponsoring person can derive from it. The shaman also liked to have many guests. During the ceremony, food was freely offered to all the participants. Therefore, it turned out to be a feast in that settlement. Most of the participants were expected to respond vocally to the sharman's invitation in order to increase the dramatic effect of the ceremony. All in all, it was a very emotional exposing of the family's problems in public. After the ceremony, the conflicts in the family were fully understood by most participants. The troubled relationship of the woman to her family [p. 192] was supposed to be repaired through the help of ancestral spirits.

Typically, a village household hires a few professional shamans to come and perform akut when an ancestor or deity is thought to have caused a serious illness or other misfortune. Offerings made to placate supernatural beings at kut consist primarily of food and money; sometimes a set of clothing is offered for a dead relative to use. Part of the food is consumed by participants during the rite; but most of the food, the money, and the occasional sets of clothing are kept by the shamans as part of their compensation. Kut are performed far less often than ancestor rituals, but each kut consumes far more time and money than a domestic or lineage rite. A given household rarely offers more than one in several years. A kut begins about mid-afternoon and runs until mid-morning of the following day. In 1978, the average cost of a kut was a few hundred U.S. dollars, about twenty times the expense of a typical death-day offering. Kut are dramatic and entertaining: shamans take turns beating drums and gongs, singing mythical narratives, performing comic skits, and impersonating supernatural beings. Speaking through [p. 149] the mouth of a shaman, deities act like corrupt and rapacious officials. They denigrate the quality of food presented to them, feign insult at the size of their offerings, and demand more and more money as they sing and dance about. Villagers refuse to be intimidated; they cajole, negotiate, and match wits with the deities, pleading for good fortune and trying to hold on to their cash. Some of the participants too play musical instruments or dance. Everyone has a good time. A portion of every kut is performed by one of the shamans especially for ancestors. This highly dramatic seance is far more serious than the exchanges with deities. Ancestors lament their discomforts in the afterlife, complain about their grave locations, or grieve over the mistreatment and neglect they suffered as elders at the hands of their living kin. Playing on the sympathies of their listeners, ancestors plead for a little more money, another cup of wine, or a different gravesite. The seance is usually performed in the early hours of the morning and is clearly one of the most important parts of every kut: informants say as much themselves, and many participants leave and return to their homes when the seance is finished. Most of the participants at a kut are women over 40; few younger women are present. Men of the sponsoring household, together with their closest kinsmen and neighbors, usually attend the early evening segments of a kut but then retire to the ""across room"" or leave the house altogether. No male villager participates in ancestor seances. At one seance, the head of the sponsoring household was physically present, but he lay on the floor, covered with a blanket, and appeared to sleep throughout the event. The women who attend a kut are drawn primarily from the sponsoring household's closest neighbors and kin; most live in the same hamlet or belong to the same ritual-performing segment. Usually, a few other women attend, especially some elderly lineage wives who take a special interest in these rites. Though no one's presence is formally required, one woman was criticized for absenting herself from an ancestor seance held at a household of her own hamlet and ritual-performing segment. The woman, an eldest son's wife, was apparently reluctant to face her dead mother-in-law. The old woman, who had committed suicide seven months earlier, made a dramatic appearance at the seance.",unknown141,calsbeek,Case,Korea,"""When I returned to my home during the last week in August, I found a shocking contrast to the mystic world I had just left.... It may seem strange to the reader unfamiliar with Far-Eastern politics that Korea, an independent nation for over forty-two centuries, should have been so helpless those first ten years of the twentieth century before the stealthy but persistent encroaching of New Japan. But Japan's strength in the East is due to rapid Westernization, especially in regard to armament. That alone, perhaps, she thoroughly learned, since the time of Perry's entrance, and is thoroughly competent to proselyte. With the vigor of a younger nation, engaged already in enormous changing, inherently imitative, it is easy for her to slough one borrowed culture and to ab-[167] sorb another in its place.

Clinging closely to the old Confucian culture, and each in an exhausted era of their history, they were truly stunned for those first decades of world-wide intercourse. That little Japan won over the million millions of wise deep China, first. After her victory, she began to make her demands upon Korea, during the Russo-Japanese war. She must be allowed passage for her troops through Korea, and she signed a treaty stating that she had no designs upon the Korean state as a whole. These troops were never withdrawn. They remained to shelter the swarms of low-class Japanese adventurers who followed, and to uphold them in all they mis-did. Japan moved deliberately step by step. She first seized the silent control of the incompetent and bewildered government at Seoul, in 1907: hemmed in by spies and Japanese generals, the old emperor was made to abdicate to a minor son; then at last Japan spoke plainly, the 29th of August, 1910, when all treaties were annulled and Korea was publicly declared annexed....""

My first thought was a selfish and immature one. 'Now I cannot be apak-sa or the prime minister of Korea.' I burst into tears. But my elders did not cry, not yet. So I ran crying out of the house. I looked up at the sky, to see if there were really a black doom up there. Were a final thunderstorm and a flood about to come which would wipe us all out? But the sky was blue and serene, and the river had only [168] a sunny crystal foam as it whirled past. Children were standing around with scared blank faces. The village was quiet. Nobody spoke. Later on, in the afternoon, there was a general weeping, everywhere the sound of mourning, as if each house in the village were wailing for somebody dead. Some men began to drink and drink, shouting: 'The doomsday has come! We have all gone to the Hell!' My father lurched out of the house, although he had had nothing to drink, and nothing to eat since morning. 'My poor poor children!' he cried out, and tears now streamed from his eyes. He held out his hands to us, as if we were all his eldest sons. 'Now all are going to die in the ruined starvation. The time of the unending famine has come down upon us.

This was the address of a radical rich friend of the crazy-poet, who used to visit him and had told me once if I ever came to Seoul, to be sure to stop and see him at the address he gave me. I spent many hungry hours thinking of the rich feast I would get at his house, and when I was tired, I comforted myself by thinking that I might stay with him two or three days to break the journey. He probably would insist on my taking some money too, I thought, which he would let me pay back later. Park Soo-San's idea was that private citizens should help poor students in search of Western education. He lived beyond Won-san, according to the address given. To reach his village, I had to go about twelve miles out of my way, along an uninviting stony path, little travelled. Since this was not in direct line to Seoul, I was constantly losing direction and making false starts; I did not reach his village until nightfall, though I had been trying to locate it from early dawn, but I persevered. The farther I came from home, the harder it was to find good schools. Lately I had [201] saved my appetite and my pennies with Mr. Kim in mind. The March evening was gray, bleak, when I entered the village of my crazy-poet uncle's friend and began inquiring for Mr. Kim, but my breast was light with anticipation, and I remember thinking, 'Turkey or duck, turkey or duck.' My Western hat and my haircut were not greeted with enthusiasm. At last when I had almost had a fight with the villagers to find out where Mr. Kim really lived, on being directed to his house, which was under sighing pine trees, I could only rouse an old woman who was deaf, and I saw no signs of the prosperity I had expected. I finally made out from what she told me, that Mr. Kim was no more, having committed suicide the night that Korea had been annexed by Japan. She alone was brave enough to live in that house because of his wailing ghost.""",military_defeat143,calsbeek,Case,Korea,"""'The most of what I have learned over here is Western politics,' I continued.

Oh, that's the kind of life I want right now.' Iyado did not catch the symbolism, but he agreed. I went home and presented Iyado with my bookcase which I prized very highly. Rather, I told him to keep it until I came back, that I was going away in the morning. Then I said: 'Good-by, I may not see you again for a long time. Well--that's that.' During the night I could not sleep because I was thinking too much about difficult things. I turned my head this way, that way, this way, that way.

[p. 263] ""Early in the morning I set out. Ninety miles I went by rail, and took a 'ricksha. When I left the 'ricksha man the path led along by a clear woodland stream. Across the stream were little arched bridges of Japanese design, delicate, ornate, like the rest of Japan's culture. On either side cherry blossoms hovered like arrested snow, unstirred by the wind. As I walked, I sang over and over to myself the Japanese song: Life holds naught to cherish Save for me the cherry tree-- Ah, cherry flowers! It was a perfect day for a poetic suicide, dull, sultry, gray, save for the pure white cherry blossoms splashing the sky, making the pensive heart throb with pain. By night would come the rain, the dreary rain."" ""I came at last to the Sacred Red Bridge, resting upon two jagged granite rocks, making one graceful, sweeping leap across a rough gorge; below was a deep pool of foaming water. I was near the spot from which I planned to make a graceful dive into the Nikko waterfall, and there let my ghost dissolve away forever like the bubbles and the rainbow. When I went up to the waterfall, it was chained off in Western manner to prevent suicides and guards were going around. I was disappointed. But I wanted to die, and I had to do it for myself because I did not see any possibilities of being killed by somebody. So I stood and watched a long time, trying to solve the problem of how to jump into the waterfall and so commit suicide. At last it got to be late afternoon and the sun's rays were shooting directly into the Fall, where the reflection was very powerful like the glory of a beautiful death. I knew I was soon to jump into that clean pure water dropping down hundreds of feet. But should I not have dinner first, because I began to be hungry?"" [p. 264-265] ""There were two fellows inside of me. One said: 'Come, let's do it right away. Make a graceful dive into that waterfall and die quick.' The other fellow was saying: 'Why not take the time? There is a lot of time yet. And why throw away the money in the pocket? That would be waste.' The most pessimistic fellow gradually won out. I grasped the chain around the waterfall, ready to vault across it, and said: 'Oh, ghosts of this waterfall, take my love to Ok-Dong-Ya and Grandmother...' At that I stopped. I had meant to jump. Oh, I should just love to have that graceful dive which I had learned and practised so many times in the sea! But what would be the consequence? Had I any right to do this? Unquestionably I would be benefited. But I alone. How about others? Ok-Dong-Ya? My grandmother? I seemed to feel somebody pulling at my arm to draw me back. My suicide would break my grandmother's heart. And Ok-Dong-Ya might commit suicide after me. Then there was my father, and Park Soo-San, and many others who were interested in me. Some of these people would go into the state of madness. Now I seemed to see my grandmother standing before me with tears in her eyes. 'No, no, no,' she was hugging me, 'my dear Chung-Pa.' (What could I do?) 'No, my dear grandmother--I would not do it--no--never.' No, a thousand times, I could not. I cried, cried, and fell down there, not knowing what happened to me. For four years I had lived my life in silence, in solitude, in independence, for this it seemed to me was virtue, dignity, beauty. And to such a life death was the logical conclusion more beautiful, virtuous, dignified than anything else I could think of. [265] 'But what a terrible thing I have done!' I thought. 'Here I am not alone. It is the love that bound me to my loved one stopped this suicide. Oh, what a happy and lucky man he is, who has no lover, nor even a friend. He can commit suicide, but I am too closely interwoven with others and full of sense of human duty.' Finally I got up, and resolved to keep on this life. I had discovered that no human being can exist if he has no loved one. This I did not know before. 'I too exist from now on because my grandmother loves me, or I love her, and many others are interested in me. That is it.'"" [p 265] ""After that my feet were light to come back to my room.

In the spring of 1939 a daughter of the village priest at Barikul who was married to a ""house son-in-law"" was discovered in the act of having sexual intercourse with a young man of the same village in the adjoining forest. There was some delay in taking action, for the headman from the aggrieved husband's village was asked to attend the council. The elders meanwhile extorted a preliminary fine of ten rupees from the guilty man, at which the young men were enraged. One of them said: ""When we are guilty of small faults you fine us five rupees; in future you should take only five annas from us."" When the council met, the amount of the fine was raised to sixty rupees. This was raised within two hours by the man selling all the livestock that he possessed. Of this sum, five rupees was for the villagers of Barikul, five rupees for the fellow villagers of the aggrieved husband, and the balance was paid to the aggrieved husband to enable him to find another wife. He was also allowed to collect from the home certain things that he had earned while living there--a spade, an axe and the brass cooking utensils. Ordinarily when a home is broken up such things are divided between the husband and the wife. On the same evening a party of the villagers accompanied him to a neighbouring village and completed a marriage ceremony for him with a new wife. Most of the usual formalities were omitted, but a bride price was paid and the marriage sealed. The guilty man was required to take the wife into his own home, but when next day the villagers found that this had not been done they went to the priest's home, where they found the young woman lying on the floor seriously ill. In spite of her condition, they took her down to her paramour's home, only to be met by his irate wife and mother brandishing axes.

The villagers solemnly debated with him whether they should report the truth and trust to the possibility of bribing the daroga, or police inspector, in order to escape further inquiry, but they decided in the end to suppress the truth and save trouble. The girl was buried deep in the forest without ceremony, and her death was later reported as being due to fever. The council then decided that they would inflict the traditional penalty for adultery on her paramour. This is twofold. Images of the two guilty persons are made and carried through the village; and, in addition, heavy stones are attached to the genitals of the man, who is then made to walk through the village.

The family head was the most highly educated person in the area--a school principal by profession--and his wealth and prestige made him a well-known figure. His family was not insensible to this. Their high evaluation of their own status was exemplified to their neighbors by the unusually high standar for sons-in-law set by the mother, who eventually married all eight daughters to wealthy men. The two sons took wives who did not get along well, and the mother of the family suffered periods of mental instability; it was not a happy household. Because of their feeling of superiority, they kept their family problems well concealed, and it was a great blow to the family pride when the mother committed suicide. To the family, already internally divided, the loss of face attendant on their tragedy was devastating. Ostensibly to avoid the grandmother's ghost, which frightened the younger children, they began to sell off their land and houses.

From a collateral branch of the matriarch's own family, young Miss Yang (1869-1895)24 had been betrothed to Ch'ao-tung's eldest son. When death removed the young man in 1884, Miss Yang considered her engagement binding, though the marriage had not yet taken place. Following the highest canons of wifely fidelity, she chose the life of a model Confucian widow, a virgin bride and virtual recluse. Residing in thekung-pao-ti , she spent [p. 222] her days in fasts and prayers and emerged from her room only long enough to pay the obligatory morning and evening calls on her parents-in-law. Only the crisis of 1895 broke her routine. As Ch'ao-tung's household prepared for flight, Miss Yang was found one day dangling from the rafters of her room, joined in death by a faithful woman servant. The roots of this unhappy dnouement are variously described. The Lins's gentry friend, Wu Te-kung, counted Miss Yang as a moral paragon and included her in his roster of the model women of the district, explaining that she had feared for her virginity during the dangerous flight. Family and village gossip, on the other hand, holds that her suicide was not voluntary but that she was pushed into it when Ch'ao-tung and Mrs. Yang sent her a white scarf with which to hang herself (according to some), or (according to others) a choice of two scarves, one red for life, the other white for purity and death.25","death_loved_one,fear of rape"176,calsbeek,Cultural model,Taiwan Hokkien,desperate maid servants committed suicide and then haunted the mansion as ghosts.,unknown177,calsbeek,Cultural model,Taiwan Hokkien,Statistics on women's suicide rates in Taiwan early in this century show the probability of suicide to be highest among women in the 20 to 24 age bracket (presumably suffering the alienation and hardsnips that afflicted young Chinese brides in their husband's natal house olds),"interpersonal_confli,disappointment in ma,alienation"178,calsbeek,Cultural model,Taiwan Hokkien,"In despair over her powerlessness or in a fit of revengeful fury at her fickle son, the aging mother contemplates, threatens, and in some cases commits suicide.","interpersonal_confli,family tension,emotional distress"179,calsbeek,Cultural model,Taiwan Hokkien,"The more common image of the widow is that of the young woman who is forced to remarry by her husband's brothers, who want control of her share of the estate.

The suicide had been buried in a little cave with his feet toward the entrance. Having deposited the food near the dead man's head, the women sat down on a stone inside, while the men stood up near the mouth of the cave, all faces turned toward the grave. The father-in-law seated himself on a stone near the feet of the dead. It was a dreary winter evening in the Sierra and the scene was singularly impressive. The old man was a strong personality, powerfully built, and a shaman of great reputation, who in his entire bearing showed his determination to keep the dead at bay. He seemed to exercise a reassuring influence over the whole assembly. I shall not easily forget the solemn and convincing way in which he upbraided the dead for his rash act. Taking the reed flower from his hair and holding it in his right hand, he waved it down and up, as if swayed by the force of his own thoughts, in accentuating his points, and he talked and argued with the dead for a quarter of an hour. The man was a great orator, and spoke so earnestly that my interpreter Nabor was affected almost to tears. The speech was a kind of dialogue with the dead, the speaker supplying the responses himself, and this is the gist of it:Why are you there?--Because I am dead.--Why are you dead?--Because I died.--Why did you die?--Because I chose to.--That is not right. You have no shame. Did your mother, who gave you birth, tell you to do this? you get for it, lying there, as you are, with stones on top of you?

He was almost at the end of his journey; all he asked were food, rest, and information about his wife. In an hour, perhaps two, it would all be over; his physical body could be thrown away while his warrior spirit would go to the land of the dead. As the days passed, he had given himself over more and more to the spirit world, his only links with reality being his rifle and his brothers. If everything and everyone else deserted him, these would remain his friends until his work was done. There was silence in the camp and, curiously, a pale light in Left Hand's cabin. Like his coyote brother, Charcoal was suspicious of anything out of the ordinary; to keep a lamp lit at four o'clock in the morning was not normal. The Indian circled the cabin, watching for signs of movement, looking for a trap. Perhaps the cabin was filled with policemen, not his brothers. Yet the snow revealed only a few scattered tracks of moccasined feet, no heavy bootprints nor the marks of many scouts. Tying his pinto to a tree about fifty yards away, Charcoal walked silently to the cabin and knocked. No answer. He knocked again. As the door slowly swung open, the fugitive relaxed for a moment when he saw the familiar face of his brother, Left Hand. Then the muscles of his face tightened, his eyes narrowed, and his voice was flat and hard. ""You have betrayed me!""1 Left Hand, his own brother, was standing before him fully clothed in the middle of the night. He was waiting to trap him! Quickly Charcoal turned and dashed to his horse, his brother following at his heels. ""There's no use,"" Left Hand called. ""Mr. Steele and Mr. Wilson told me you'd better give yourself up. It'll be better for you!"" ""No, I won't. I'm going on.""2 Left Hand wrapped his arms around his brother, pulling him away from the horse. At this first act of violence, Charcoal tried to raise his rifle but the brother called for help; moments later Left Hand's wife and Bear Back Bone were upon the desperate man, tearing away his rifle, grabbing his butcher knife, and wrestling him to the ground. In dismay Charcoal struggled with his brothers. He had beaten the police, the scouts, the ranchers, everyone. Of all people, his brothers understood his mission, his need to kill a chief and his faithless wife. They knew about his wish to go to the Sand Hills as a leader, and they realized what would happen to his spirit if the police captured and hanged him. This thing couldn't be happening! He felt his body being pushed and dragged through the snow toward the cabin; his arms [p. 150] pinioned at his sides; his sister-in-law, his fat sister-in-law, sitting squarely on his shoulders. It was no dream; it was real. At that moment, his rifle gone, betrayed by his brothers, Charcoal surrendered to the real world. ""I give up,"" he said to Left Hand. ""Now you can be a chief for catching me.""3 All fight left him as he lay on the earthen floor, a tired and beaten man. He heard his brother shout for White Buffalo Chief, Big Plume, and Willie Red Crow to help him, that he had captured Charoal. A little later, White Man Left, Calf Chief, and Chief Moon arrived, curiously watching their onetime friend who now lay before them like a gaunt, trapped animal. Charcoal was allowed to sit in a chair, and there, huddled down with his hood pulled over his head, the exhausted man appeared to sleep while waiting for the police to come from Standoff. There was no hope now of killing Pretty Wolverine Woman; in fact, Left Hand had told him the police had locked her up in Macleod. Cautiously, with a movement so slight that it scarcely disturbed his winter coat, Charcoal grasped an awl which was hidden in his clothes. He didn't want this body any longer; his brothers could have it. The sharp point of the awl pierced through the skin of his arm and into a vein. And again. Chief Moon, sitting on a woodpile near the door, saw something moving on the floor. It looked like a dark, dirt-covered worm. ""What's that?"" he asked. ""Where?""4 When they raised Charcoal's coat to discover what was causing the shifting soil, they saw a sprawling pool of blood under his chair. When his coat was pulled back, the blood came spurting from his arm. Charcoal weakly tried to push them away, but they covered his wounds with flour and bound them with strips of cotton. Why didn't they let him die? Even the coyote, after it had taunted its last dog, stolen its last food, killed its last enemy was allowed to die as it wished. It might crawl into a cave, be torn apart by a savage pack of dogs, or even be destroyed by its own kind. Charcoal's adventure was over and he wanted to die; he was ready to abandon this world in which no one wanted him to stay.

Young men seldom spoke to young girls who were not relations, and the girls were carefully guarded.

The girl, therefore, had very little choice in the selection of a husband. If a girl was told she must marry a certain man, she had to obey. She might cry, but her father's will was law, and she might be beaten or even killed by him, if she did not do as she was ordered. As a consequence of this severity, suicide was quite common among the Blackfoot girls. A girl ordered to marry a man whom she did not like would often watch her chance, and go out in the brush and hang herself.

And while suicides by frustrated children were not actually frequent, there are nevertheless a number of recorded cases of suicide where parental interference was the avowed cause.

The victim, a married man and not very old, hanged himself at his winter camp. When news of the event reached the village his close relatives, and others to a lesser extent, showed great emotion. For the first few days afterwards, the deceased's brother wandered about staring absently, never smiling, and shaking visibly. The man's mother was even more noticeably upset than his brother, even weeping slightly. The first night after learning of her son's death, she kept the whole household awake because of her distressed condition. No mention was made by any member of the family as to why the man had committed suicide. One informant said that when the dead man's brother was feeling better he would tell the people the cause of it. The man's name was not mentioned in conversation until some time after the death. Instead the man was always referred [p. b62] to as ""so and so's brother"" or as ""the man who hanged himself."" At first no explanation was given for the suicide. Soon it was suggested that the man had hanged himself because he was depressed. It was said by informants that the man had been in jail and that this was hard, and the food bad. The fact of having been in jail, it was implied, had preyed on his mind until he had killed himself.1 To bolster their argument, informants referred to another recent case of suicide. In this case the man had just returned from jail and had no job. He was threatened with jail again and as a result committed suicide. Whatever the truth of these assertions may be they do indicate on the part of the [unavailable]ound Lake Ojibwa their fear of jails, policemen, and Canadian law and their latent hostility toward the Euro-Canadian. About a month later a new interpretation was offered of the suicide. The informant who gave this was quite concerned over the death. He felt there might have been trouble (i.e. witchcraft).2 When the body was found it was suspended by only a small cord passing under the chin. It was not tied about the neck. The informant did not think that a cord fixed in this way could have caused death. It was added that right after the man hanged himself a hare approached the house where his widow was staying. The hare was not afraid and she killed it. It was very strange that the hare was not afraid. The informant could not adequately explain this, and it was of great concern to him. The informant also thought it strange that two of the surviving brothers had now separated. There must have been trouble somewhere. Perhaps, therefore, a ""bad man"" had killed him. Yet at the same time the informant knew of no enemies of this man, nor had any strange tracks been seen about the place. Nevertheless the informant's father had also suggested to him that it might have been the work of a mite-na[dot]pe[dot]. The informant simply did not know how it happened, and finally suggested that perhaps the man had gone out of his mind temporarily. The informant's brother had done this just before he died. His spirit (ahca[dot]hk) had left him and he was unconscious. The fear of witchcraft seems clear and is indicated in other cases of deaths reported. Witchcraft as an explanation is brought forward after the death has been fully discussed and all the strange events surrounding the event have had time to be remembered (and elaborated?), and told by all those in the vicinity. Then a case for witchcraft is usually established. The idea that witchcraft is the cause of death is further strengthened by the following statements about the same case of suicide. A different informant said that both he and his father-in-law had dreams the night after the community had been notified that a hanging had occurred. The man's father-in-law had a dream in which he was attacked by an animal but he was able to throw the animal into a snowbank and therefore the situation was not too bad. If he had not been able to cast the animal aside then it would have meant bad luck. The informant did not elaborate but merely said he had had a dream of premonition of the same type. He and his father-in-law discussed the matter. It was an evil ""cloud"" or ""substance"" that had followed the deceased man's brother back to the village from the south. Apparently the evil in this case had been unable to do further harm. There is another factor that enters into this case. It was implied rather than explicitly stated by a member of the family that the suicide was a form of [p. b63] punishment inflicted on the family.1 The man's mother had remarried without consulting her brothers and now they had all sorts of troubles, the suicide being merely one of many. Witchcraft, supernatural retribution, and fear and hostility towards Euro-Canadians become inextricable inter-woven in determining an explanation for this suicide.","spirit_attack,imprisonment,fear of imprisonment"305,calsbeek,Case,Ojibwa,Two Cat Lake men have recently killed themselves2 and two men at Pickle Lake.

One night he was being beaten up by other kids because he had stolen a 40-oz bottle of rye and had drunk it all by himself. We took him home and stayed with him all night because he was close to alcohol poisoning. He thrashed about in a wild frenzy and kept screaming that he needed ""to have a fuck!"" As he began to sober up in the morning, he said he wanted to die. He was serious and calm and determined to kill himself. At seven that morning, his mother burned her house down. She had been drinking all night too. She lit a fire in the bedroom and one in the kitchen and then went outside and watched the house burn to the ground. Here we were. We had Stewart wanting to die and watching his house go up in flames. The worst part was that in her stupor, his mother suddenly remembered that maybe one of her other children was still inside the burning house.

While we were engaged in collecting and preparing the grain, many among us were seized with a violent sickness. It commenced with cough and hoarseness, and sometimes bleeding from the mouth or nose. In a short time many died, and none were able to hunt. Although I did not escape entirely, my attack appeared at first less violent than that of most others. There had been for several days no meat in the encampment. Some of the children had not been sick, and some of those who had been sick, now began to recover, and needed some food. There was but one man beside myself as capable of exertion as I was, and he, like myself, was recovering. We were wholly unable to walk, and could scarce mount our horses when they were brought to us by the children. Had we been able to walk, we coughed so loudly and so incessantly that we could never have approached near enough to any game to kill it by still hunting. In this emergency we rode into the plains, and were fortunate enough to overtake and kill a bear. Of the flesh of this animal we could not eat a mouthful, but we took it home and distributed to every lodge an equal portion. Still I continued to get better, and was among the first to regain my health, as I supposed. In a few days I went out to hunt elk, and in killing two of them in the space of two or three hours, I became somewhat excited and fatigued. I cut up the meat, and as is usual, took home a load on my back when I returned. I ate heartily of some which they cooked for me, then lay down and slept, but before the middle of the night, I was waked by a dreadful pain in my ears. It appeared to me that something was eating into my ears, and I called Wa-me-gon-a-biew to look, but he could see nothing. The pain became more and more excruciating for two days, at the end of which time I became insensible. When my consciousness returned, which was, as I learned afterwards, at the end of two days, I found myself sitting outside [p. 96] the lodge. I saw the Indians on all sides of me drinking, some trader having come among them. Some were quarrelling, particularly a group amongst which I distinguished Wa-me-gon-a-biew, and saw him stab a horse with his knife. Then I immediately became insensible and remained so probably for some days, as I was unconscious of every thing that passed until the band were nearly ready to move from the place where we had been living. My strength was not entirely gone, and when I came to my right mind, I could walk about. I reflected much on all that had passed since I had been among the Indians. I had in the main been contented since residing in the family of Net-no-kwa, but this sickness I looked upon as the commencement of misfortune which was to follow me through life. My hearing was gone for abscesses had formed and discharged in each ear, and I could now hear but very imperfectly. I sat down in the lodge, and could see the faces of men, and their lips moving, but knew not what they said. I took my gun and went to hunt, but the animals discovered me before I could see them, and if by accident I saw a moose or an elk, and endeavoured to get near him, I found that my cunning and my success had deserted me. I soon imagined that the very animals knew that I had become like an old and useless man. Under the influence of these painful feelings, I resolved to destroy myself, as the only means of escaping the certain misery which I saw before me. When they were ready to move, Net-no-kwa had my horse brought to the door of the lodge, and asked me if I was able to get on and ride to the place where they intended to encamp. I told her I was, and requesting that my gun might be left with me, said I would follow the party at a little distance. I took the rein of my horse's bridle in my hand, and sitting down, watched the people as group after group passed me and disappeared. When the last old woman, and her heavy load of pukkwi mats, sunk behind the little swell of the prairie that bounded my prospect, I felt much relieved. I cast loose the reins of the bridle, and suffered my horse to feed at large. I then cocked my gun, and resting the butt of it on the ground, [p. 97] I put the muzzle to my throat, and proceeded with the ramrod, which I had drawn for the purpose, to discharge it. I knew that the lock was in good order; also, that the piece had been well loaded but a day or two before; but I now found that the charge had been drawn. My powder horn and ball pouch always contained more or less ammunition, but on examination, I found them empty. My knife also, which I commonly carried appended to the strap of my shot pouch, was gone. Finding myself baffled in the attempt to take my own life, I seized my gun with both hands by the muzzle, and threw it from me with my utmost strength, then mounted my horse, who, contrary to his usual custom, and to what I had expected from him, had remained near me after being released. I soon overtook the party, for being probably aware of my intentions, Wa-me-gon-a-biew and Net-no-kwa had gone but far enough to conceal themselves from my view, and had then sat down to wait. It is probable that in my insane ravings, I had talked of my intention to destroy myself, and on this account they had been careful to deprive me of the most ordinary and direct means of effecting my purpose.","failure or sense of ,illness,no or low contributi,emotional distress"319,calsbeek,Case,Ojibwa,"Some years previous to the time I now speak of, I was with Net-no-kwa, at Mackinac, when I knew a very promising and highly respected young man of the Ottawwaws who shot himself in the Indian burying grounds. He had, for the first time, drank to intoxication, and in the alienation of mind produced by the liquor had torn off his own clothes, and behaved with so much violence that his two sisters, to prevent him from injuring himself or others, tied his hands and feet, and laid him down in the lodge. Next morning, he awoke sober, and being untied, went to his sister's lodge, which was near the burying ground, borrowed a gun, under pretense of going to shoot pigeons, and went into the burying ground and shot himself. It is probable that when he awoke and found himself tied, he thought he had done something very improper in his drunkenness, and to [p. 98] relieve himself from the pressure of shame and mortification, had ended his days by violence.","alienation,family shame"320,calsbeek,Cultural model,Ojibwa,"Misfortunes and losses of various kinds, sometimes the death of friends, and possibly, in some instances, disappointment in affairs of love, may be considered the causes which produce suicide among the Indians.","death_loved_one,failed romantic rela,disappointment in ma,bad luck"321,calsbeek,Case,Pawnee,"The conditions of idleness only served to reinforce the revival of the old cultural forms.

The experiences of these years, even while the Ghost Dance brought some hope into their lives, caused a number of young men to commit suicide.Eight suicides were recorded in the period from 1892 to 1898.

Traveling was very hard. The old woman who was keeper of the Skull bundle struck him on the back and said, ""You will shell corn, will you. See what you have done!"" That year it was so hot that the crops burned up.

It is better if I and his child within me die with him."" But he wished to kill only his nephew.

They agreed to take their wives and children and to go away themselves. Near Ketchikan is a humpback-salmon creek called Ana'n, owned by the Tekwedih. Tlawah went where the Ganaxadi had fishing camps, while Yetlcanih and his group went to Anan. Later he went to the Ganaxadi camp, because his wife was soon to have her child and he came to kill his nephew. It was night and high tide.

A number of social pressures, responsiveness to which is learned from early childhood, aid in keeping order and forcing the individual to accept the punishment meted out to him by the authorities. Almost every individual, when he has engaged in an unlawful act, will first attempt to escape from the authorities. In some situations, this escape is an adequate defense, but this is never true in the case of crimes which would endanger the stability or life [p. 43] of the community if they were permitted. In the case of a child's disobedience of his parents, if he runs inland and hides, he becomes the object of so much concern that he is welcomed rather than punished when he is found. This defense mechanism, which is so effective in childhood, is carried over into adult life. The wife, who has been discovered as an adultress, runs inland to hide from her husband who would beat her. She escapes his beating, but the police will look for her, and she will be jailed. In a quarrel between spouses, the wife will sometimes run inland and hide, and the husband will go to search for her. This generally is the basis for a happy reunion. The anthropologist wondered why these people were not merely left to hide until they grew hungry enough to return. Informants said that there was a constant danger such a person might commit suicide.

We have seen this strongly implied in the marked desire for conformance to expected patterns of behavior and the suppression of any behavior which might result in a disruptive or hostile episode. This anxiety over being rejected by a kinsman reaches its most dramatic expression in suicide. The threat of suicide is often made in other situations and is frequently effective, as in the case of the thwarted lovers described in a previous chapter; Theodore finally forced acceptance of his resignation as chief by this means also. But in the four cases actually recorded (one of them observed) where a genuine attempt was made to commit suicide, the precipitating factor was always harsh and unkind words from a close relative.","interpersonal_confli,rejection,loss_social_position,family tension"384,calsbeek,Cultural model,Chuuk,"This examination revealed quite clearly that in really difficult situations the women do indeed act more adequately than the men. For example, it is only the men who, faced with rejection by their relatives, can find no solution outside of suicide; on the other hand, in the dilemma created by the arrangement of an undesirable marriage by the parents in our cases it was only the girl who was able to launch an effective protest.","interpersonal_confli,rejection,forced marriage,family tension,alienation"385,calsbeek,Cultural model,Chuuk,"However, a response which could best be called diffuse does result in situations which are characterized by high hostility and high anxiety, but in which it is apparently impossible to express the aggression felt in a direct manner. Such conditions obtain primarily in the event of strong rejection and censure or discipline by members of the family group. As we have seen, at the adult level fighting is possible between close relatives, although in the cases recorded the precipitating cause appeared to be an argument or accusation rather than more direct rejection. In any event, whatever the cause, there are instances in which the individual concerned appears to feel unable to make an actual hostile act toward the other person, and it is under these conditions that suicide or attempted suicide takes place. For children, the corresponding behavior is to run away, and, as we have seen, when adults run away (especially in the event that parents refuse to recognize their desires for marriage) there is an explicit assumption that they are concurrently intending suicide, thus showing even more clearly that these two types of behavior may be considered comparable. In both cases, the behavior is diffuse: the children do not run away anywhere, they just run away; in regard to suicide, the description which appears in Chapter 8 of Andy's attempted suicide shows clearly the diffuseness of his reaction--picking up an iron bar, then a stick, beating the house (a completely ineffectual move), and finally running up the tree. But more important than the diffuseness of these reactions--and here we go beyond the tests results--this [p. 242] behavior is damaging to the individual concerned: it is essentially masochistic. That this is true of suicide is obvious; if we recollect that separation from the charmed circle of family and kinsmen produces strong anxiety in itself, and that being away, often at night, from dwellings invites the attacks of ghosts, as well as insects and rain, we realize that running away is itself anything but pleasurable. In this class of behavior, then, we see that aggression strongly felt but impossible of direct expression is in effect turned upon the self, and, ironically, the hostile and rejecting threat made by the relative is translated into actual separation and personal harm by the masochistic reaction of the thwarted and desperate individual. It is conjectural whether Sarason, had he been poised to look for it, could have found direct evidence in the projective test records which would have permitted him to predict this type of behavior. It could, however, have been predicted from the hypothesis already formulated on the basis of other direct evidence, for it is a basic premise of psychological theory that aggression strongly felt but impossible or difficult of direct expression tends to be deflected inward upon the self.

Suddenly, Q broke and ran past my house back toward the poolhall yelling like crazy at everyone in general. A few moments later, Q dashed back up the valley road, still screaming shrilly, and burst into a homesite as if to cause trouble there. The next thing I knew, someone grabbed Q and threw him hard into the sloppy mud puddles in the valley road. To my astonishment the man who had forcibly reprimanded Q was none other than his father, a man in his early fifties. The father sat on top of Q and easily got the upper hand as they continued to grapple. A sober young man from the household Q had threatened to attack watched them but made no attempt to intervene. The wrestling and shouting continued for several minutes until Q's father lost his patience and began violently beating his son in the face and chest. When his father finally released him, Q leapt up instantly and charged wildly down the valley road toward my house, wailing eerily. Two young women in their early twenties, one of whom was holding a small child, were standing in the road. Q rushed straight at them but they did not move. On reaching them, Q leapt up and slapped one loudly on the back with his open hand and then fell in a heap on the ground beside them. He lay there a moment, got up, and ran off toward the poolhall once more. Within minutes his older brother and father had collared him and again began dragging him up the valley road against his will. As before, he began struggling violently with his father until once again his father threw him down and jumped on him, this time choking him briefly. Q's father then stood up and strode off, leaving him lying very still in the road, watched over by his brother. Following a five-minute interlude in these fast-breaking events while he just lay in the road, Q got up slowly, and his brother led him homeward. I learned that Q, age 22, had been drinking with some other young men and was found by his father. His father had earlier forbidden him to drink and had sought unsuccessfully to get all his sons to take the mwichen asor pledge; seeing Q drunk so angered him that he lost his temper and the result was what I observed.

Under the general heading of suicides from domestic discord may be placed the consequences of revolt against parental authority.

In 1929 a son of the Ariki Tafua fell ill and the chief became very disturbed about this. He had been baptized as a Christian, but this had not meant that he had abandoned all belief in the reality of his traditional gods and spirits. He regarded the illness of his son as due to the action of some malicious spirits, and seeing his son get weaker and imagining that he would die he attempted suicide by hanging (p. 138). This was a despairing act given the rationalization of shaming his traditional gods for not looking after his family. When his suicide attempt had been prevented (and it was never quite clear how far the chief had hoped it would be prevented) he addressed his gods, reproaching them for wanting to take the life of a young man while he himself, an old man, still remained. According to Tikopia belief, in response to this reproach the gods allowed his son to recover, but made the chief himself ill. From this illness he was in turn in Tikopia eyes saved by the effort of his peers, the Ariki Kafika and Ariki Taumako, both pagan chiefs, who visited him and laid hands on him. In the course of the rites which accompanied these proceedings the Ariki Tafua, who was a spirit medium, twice entered the trance state, and in spirit form gave utterance to reassuring statements. But the day before he became ill he had also had a trance and in spirit form spoke to the assembled company, saying 'Who is the man who told the chief that he should hang himself?' The spirit appeared to be very angry. His eldest son and another senior man crawled across the floor of the house to him, and pressed their noses one to each of his knees in token of obeisance. Then they and all the others present in the house assured the spirit that he was mistaken, that it had been the idea of the chief himself alone that he should commit suicide, that no one else had advised him to do so. At last the spirit appeared to be appeased and the trance ended.","spirit_attack,illness,fear of loss,psychological distre"413,calsbeek,Case,Tikopia,"Yet sometimes, despite the inhibiting factors, the tensions in a person did seem to lead him to an obsessional suicidal act.

The usual searching fleet went out to find him; but was unsuccessful. The story told in the latter case illustrates one important aspect of Tikopia belief--the reality conveyed in dreams. It also reveals the complexity of Tikopia attitudes towards the suicidal act. When the searching fleet was out, it was said that a shark was observed going up and down along the side of one of the canoes. Not unnaturally the crew interpreted this as a sign that sharks were in the vicinity and that the lost man had been eaten, so turned for shore. Later, however, the canoe owner had a dream in which the dead man appeared to him and made known his fate. The shark had not been there as his slayer; it was a protector and was intending to show the crew that the man was still alive, and to lead the canoe to him. But seeing that the crew [p. 361] refused to follow, the shark turned back and did eat the man. In the dream, the dead man bewailed his fate in a song: Turn to me your stern Turn to me your stern But the fish went in the path Of the ocean. My swimming, my long swimming In the ocean wastes My body nuzzled by the grey birds (albatross?) This story confirms the view expressed earlier (Chapter 5) that for Tikopia the suicidal act may be a risk venture, in which the would-be suicide at some point wishes for rescue, but may have weighted the chances too heavily against himself to survive. Even if in this case the fact may have not been so, the dream illustrates the Tikopia concept of suicide mentality. The story also illustrates one important continuing aspect of Tikopia belief--that dreams express an external reality and not a reality purely internal to the dreamer. This external reality still commonly includes what may be termed spirit entities.

The Ariki Tafua in 1929 said that he acted through fear; others, that he acted through shame. Whatever be the reason, tradition states that he determined to abandon the land with all his followers and put off to sea. This is the traditional Tikopia method of committing suicide, carried out by a group of people, either in protest against what they consider to be an unfair accusation, or when guilty of some offence against a man of rank. Normally, when passions have not been aroused too highly, the suicide voyage is stopped by a formal procedure on the part of some other member of the community. In this case, however, resentment and landgreed appear to have been paramount, and no hand was raised to stay Nga Faea, who went off in the grand manner. The Ariki said to his people, ""Let us all go to the ocean [p. 139] indeed that the soil of Namo shall stand"". (Tou o tatou ki moana ia ke tu ko a kere o Namo .) By this he is said to have meant, ""If we stay on land we shall die; if we go to sea we shall die; let us go then and abandon our territory to the people of Tafua."" Accordingly, he and the majority of his followers took to sea. The Ariki Tafua said they numbered a hundred, and if they exceeded Nga Ariki in numbers and there was pressure of the latter on the land, Nga Faea must have been more numerous. The women and children were in the canoes; many of the men swam alongside. According to one account, the canoes were decorated with barkcloth streamers, as if it were a gala ritual occasion. Wailing, the folk of Nga Faea abandoned the land, some of them supporting their chief on the deck of his vessel, holding him aloft in their arms, in the gesture of supreme respect which the Tikopia pay to men of rank. (According to Pa Torokinga, this support was given to the chief after his canoe sank.) So they went from sight, to be lost forever from the knowledge of men. Closely associated with the chiefly lineage of Nga Faea were the lineages of the ritual elders. One of these was Kaiutu, an offshoot of the chiefly lineage; others were the lineages of Raromei, Rangiripo, Maraekaro and Vokisa. All the last-named, together with members of other lineages whose titles have been forgotten (it is said) went off to sea with their chief.

'As it were I who sit here, I look on my children who are starving. I get my canoe ready to go. If a chief comes to block me I say ""Shall I stay here to steal from your orchards? Or are you prepared to feed me?"" Then he is silent and lets me go....' This brings out the way in which the issues are conceptualized by the Tikopia in terms of choices: a man chooses between starvation on land and death at sea; his choice initially disallowed, he puts the situation in term of a further choice by his chief. Note that the resolution is seen in a social compulsion--the chief, embarrassed at not having the wherewithal to feed his clansman, is compelled by shame to retract his ban on the suicids voyage. This conversation is patterned in type; it is the ideal mode. But the situation thus described is not merely as academic one. Voyages of this kind are said to have occurred in past famines.

The final outcome of this is to mobilize a force of public opinion against the rumored action. Other men of rank will see that the suicide voyage is not undertaken (4, p. 184).

As a rule, however, the natives say, he abandons himself to his fate, and either allows himself to drift on the ocean till he perishes of thirst, or is overwhelmed by the waves, or takes the initiative and slips overboard to meet his death in the maw of a hungry shark. To be eaten by these monsters of the deep is in fact regarded by the Tikopia as the normal conclusion to being set adrift in this manner. In suicide the same procedure is followed. Voluntary self destruction and the punishment of crime are intimately connected, since when a serious offence has been committed the guilty person often anticipates the sentence by setting off in a canoe on his own initiative. It is worthy of remark that in this case the vessel is often not his own. Women commit suicide or, in rare instances, suffer punishment by swimming out to sea. Unlike the men they do not go out to meet their fate in a canoe: such is not the custom. On this account their end is more speedy, though hardly more certain: sooner or later, the natives think, the shark gets his prey.",unknown426,calsbeek,Case,Tikopia,"A few years ago a dramatic incident occurred which illustrates both the sacredness of the rite and the dread which is entertained of the atua by the people at large. The bearers were carrying the stone down to the beach for its customary cleansing when they noticed that someone - probably a child - had deposited excrement in the path. Since this would have been defiling to the atua they turned aside from the sacred track, and went along by the house of Niukapu which stood near. In due course they returned, and the kava was prepared. As the ritual was being performed the chief and the people were astounded to hear a succession of whoops from the direction of the shore. ""Iefu!"" ""Iefu!"" ""Iefu!"" Several men at once seized their axes and ran down in anger, to find out who it was who had dared to violate the sanctity of the occasion in this challenging fashion. They discovered the culprit, Pa Niukapu, outside his house. Raising their axes to strike, they lashed him with their tongues. To their abuse and reproaches the offender answered not a word but sat with bowed head, and wailed. At last he said, ""Launch my canon; I am going to sea"" - a notification that he would commit suicide in expiation of his offence. Then the Ariki Kafika had sympathy for him since in times long past the ancestor of Pa Niukapu, a famous navigator, had perished at sea in the same canoe as his nephew, the ancestor of the Ariki Kafika. The traditional saying is ""Te kerekere o te Ariki, ne poi ma ko ia"" ""The earth of the chief, who went with him,"" meaning that he supported the chief by his presence in his last moments, and accompanied him to his ocean grave. This ancestral link still counts for much, and was responsible for the lenient atitude of the Ariki on this occasion. Instead of confirming the intention of suicide he said ""No! we are angry because you have whooped like this; but there is no need to go out to sea"". Finally after more talk the party returned and finished their rites. Later, after the group dispersed, the Ariki and Pa Porima sat on at Takarito. Then came Pa Koroatu the brother of Pa Niukapu, and Vaitere, his son, with gifts of bananas and breadfruit to the chief. Crawling to him along the ground, they pressed their noses to his knee, as the custom is, in token of their humility. ""The one fool in Tikopia,"" said Pa Koroatu of his brother.

This is a hypothetical procedure, advanced by my informants in reply to questioning, and not tested by observation, since I did not witness such a scene, nor could anyone tell me of an instance. The striking of father by son is indeed almost out of the realm of native social behaviour, since a violent reaction of the son against the father would lead him to suicide direct, as not infrequently happens.

However, its effectiveness lies in the fact that this pattern of the young couple running away (which is reminiscent of children hiding away when they have been beaten) carries implicit in it the threat that they will commit suicide by hanging themselves in the bush if they are further refused. A great search is undertaken and when the couple are discovered everyone is immensely relieved to find them still alive, even though they may have actually never mentioned suicide to anyone.","interpersonal_confli,inability to marry,family tension"659,calsbeek,Cultural model,Chuuk,"In his provocative article on the sweetheart relationship, Swartz (1958) concludes that men more than women deal with their aggressive feelings by turning them inward upon themselves. Along these lines of masochistic masculine aggression in Truk it is worth recalling that the vast majority of suicides in Greater Trukese Society likewise involve males rather than females (see chapter 4, case 10 and Hezel 1976). I submit that drunkenness may be profitably viewed as an extension of this proclivity for male masochism. While drunk, young men quite frequently get reprimanded by elder kinsmen, thrown in jail, beaten up, wounded, and occasionally even killed. All this inward aggression is brought on voluntarily by assuming the social identity of the drunk. Young male Trukese drunks prove their courage as much by their ability to withstand pain resulting from masochistic exposure to danger as by overt aggressive acts against others.","psychological distre,emotional distress"672,calsbeek,Cultural model,Tikopia,"The views of the more sophisticated Tikopia Christians follow those of their priest. For example, one man who had himself been a Mission teacher discussed the Christian attitude to suicide. Each man's soul belongs to God and each man should await the time of his death, 'following the will of the Lord'. Hence the man who commits suicide does not go to Paradise, he goes to Satan. The reason for this is that the Bible says it is wrong for a man to take his own life. If a person should commit suicide then it is for the priest to make the proper prayers at the altar of the church so that the soul of the man may go to the proper place. The family of the person cannot themselves perform this service or intercede with God in any way--only the priest can do this. Normally the family of a suicide does not make any special inquiry about his fate. But if they do worry about the situation they may go to the priest and ask him for special prayers, and they substantiate their request by presenting to the priest a pandanus mat.

Therefore, when in a strange camp, while on a journey or at a fair, voluntary death is executed by other means than stabbing.

The victim, usually a young Trukese male, hangs himself after he is scolded, refused a request, or otherwise rebuffed by parents or an older sibling (Hezel 1984). So common is this pattern that Trukese, upon hearing of a recent suicide, will invariably ask what the victim was angry about. The introverted display of anger, far from being pathological, is an ordinary enough feature in a culture that prohibits the venting of strong negative feelings towards parents and older kin. Since a Trukese, bound as he is by the strong respect code of his society, cannot manifest directly his anger at family members who are his superior in age and status, he acts out this anger upon himself. Suicide is not the only way of doing this; a young man may wound himself or refuse to eat in order to convey the same message. It might be noted that those cases (10 in all) in which the victim commits suicide because of anger at a spouse are more difficult to explain in these terms, for direct and sometimes violent displays of anger at wives are commonplace and expected occurrences in Truk. Nonetheless, there are relatively rare occasions on which a Trukese has employed an introverted method of displaying anger towards a spouse or a younger brother or other social inferior rather than the culturally sanctioned and more direct means of expressing his feelings. There is a common strand running through the first two patterns that requires some elucidation. When faced with a conflict-laden situation, especially within the close circles of kin, Trukese will frequently resort to a strategy of withdrawal rather than confrontational tactics. This coping mechanism, which is in keeping with similar tendencies throughout Micronesia and Polynesia, is sometimes referred to as amwunumwun by Trukese. Amwunumwun means to distance oneself from others as a way of giving vent to strong feelings, whether anger or shame, when it is culturally inappropriate to display these feelings more directly. Embracing an arsenal of more specific behaviors that range from refusing to speak or eat to taking ones own life, amwunumwun represents a way of manifesting anger or other negative emotions through some form of self-debasement (Rubinstein 1984; Hezel 1984). The act of amwunumwun is intended not principally to inflict revenge, although there is sometimes an element of this motivation in the act, but to dramatize ones sorrows, frustration and shame in the hope that the present unhappy situation will somehow be remedied. When the suicide victim performs his act of amwunumwun, therefore, it is at least partially in the hope that the sad state into which his relationship with his family has fallen might be restored to what it once was or should have been, even if this occurs on the other side of the grave. Young males in Truk, as we have seen, are at particularly high risk for suicide. If present rates continue, Rubinstein (1985:92) points out, one out of every 40 Trukese males will die by his own hand between their 15th and 25th birthdays. It is no coincidence that this same sex/age group shows the highest incidence of alcohol-related problems, arrests and imprisonment, and even incidence of serious mental illness (Hezel 1985b). In an age-ranked society such as Truk, the young are especially vulnerable, perhaps even more so than the aged are in a society like the U.S. that idolizes youth. In Truk the young have not yet achieved a status of respect in the community and will not do so until, often well into their 30s, they have begun to raise a family and demonstrate the competence and stability that are so prized in the culture. A third feature is the cultural constraint on the expression of feelings, especially negative feelings, that has been mentioned previously. In Truk, as in many other Pacific societies, elaborate social structures have been erected so as to minimize the outbreaks of hostility and thus maintain unbroken peace in a community that is usually quite small. Yet, the same option that minimizes the risk of open conflict also reduces the availability of defense mechanisms and so leaves the person more vulnerable to injuries from others (Howard 1979:137). While restrictions against verbalizing anger towards ones social superiors undoubtedly reduce the danger of explosive arguments, they also deprive the young man of a method of venting and diffusing his anger. The search by young men for avenues of self-expression underlies much of their drunken behavior as well as their readiness to utilize suicide as a means of acting out their anger and shame (Hezel 1981:17; Marshall 1979:109-111). Still another feature, one alluded to but not explicitly treated above, is the thirst for recognition among the young. This is a particularly strong need for those who perceive their affiliation with their family group as tenuous and marginal, whether because of their adoptive status or because they are not contributing to the wellbeing of the family through normal chores. The form of recognition they seek is not effusive compliments, something alien to Trukese ways, but an acknowledgement of their importance in more indirect ways, particularly a fair share in the allotment of food and family resources. This is an extremely sensitive issue for young Trukese today as in the past. Yet, as the demands upon young men to assist in food preparation and other tasks diminish, so too does their sense of their own importance to their family. Suicide clearly affords them a means of recognition, as victims have often indicated before their death. Some have alluded with a note of triumph to the funeral feast that would be held in their honor as if they expected to achieve in death the recognition that they had been denied in life. At least three others, all of them adopted sons, have timed their deaths to coincide with the anniversary of another death in their adoptive family, no doubt as a way of expressing their desire for full assimilation into the family and ensuring that the anniversary of their own death would be a major family event in years to come. One young man even left his footprint and signature in wet cement on the floor of the family meeting house to memorialize himself and his deed. The attraction that such a dramatic form of recognition holds for young Trukese is attested by one 13-year-old boy who exclaimed while witnessing the funeral of a suicide victim not much older than himself, How nice it would be to have all those people crying and making a fuss over me! (Hezel 1985a:120).","rejection,family tension,anomie/social tensio,emotional distress"1863,calsbeek,Cultural model,Chuuk,"Suicide among young men in Truk is another serious problem that has developed in recent years (Hezel 1984, 1987a; Rubinstein 1983, 1987). Although we cannot say being drunk causes young men to take their own lives in Truk, nevertheless, most such suicides are drunk at the time of the act. Sometimes, as well, the apparent precipitating incident leading a young man to suicide involves an issue around alcohol. For example, a suicide may have just been scolded by a close relative for drinking or for misdeeds committed while drunk or he may have been refused money with which to purchase more liquor. No evidence exists that prohibition has had any direct influence on this particular kind of violent behavior in Truk.",unknown1864,calsbeek,Cultural model,Chuuk,"Suicide is today the leading cause of death among Micronesians age 15 to 30. Hezel (1976) observes that these deaths follow a quite regular pattern all over the Trust Territory. Most victims are young males from districts in eastern Micronesia (especially Truk and the Marshalls) who have just had an emotional argument with a close relative or friend. Most had been drinking alcoholic beverages before committing suicide, which is usually done by hanging. By virtue of suffering over one half of all suicides in the Trust Territory from 1975 to 1976, Truk District has acquired the unenviable title of the suicide capital of Micronesia (Hezel 1976:9). Hezel argues that neither the drinking nor the family quarrel that normally precedes these suicides can explain them. Rather he suggests that we view them as acts of vengeance against those who are the objects of the victims anger. In [Page 79] Greater Trukese Society, at least, consumption of alcohol bolsters the young mans courage to do deeds of bravery (including killing himself), but suicide itself is an act of aggression against close kinsmen who have somehow pushed the victim over the brink of despair by rejecting him in an emotional confrontation. Under such circumstances, his only way for vengeance is to kill himself and let his tormentors suffer guilt thereafter.

Tihget's mother was Takuye'tl and his uncle (mother's brother) was Yetlcani'h (old raven). The uncle's wife was quite young while her husband, Yetlcanih, was along in years. She took a fancy to Tihget, who was living in his uncle's house, as is customary. One day on the pretext of giving him some clothing and tobacco she asked him into her bedroom and began making love to him. Eventually he yielded. That same night she felt she was pregnant. Her husband was away at the time. He returned, and after some months he asked her how it was that her menses had stopped. Then she confessed to her affair. She was childless and she hoped her husband would give her to his nephew Tihget as a wife [a fairly common custom]. But the husband was angry and threatened to kill Tihget, saying, ""If I forgive him the next generation will do the same thing."" Tihget was blas and said, ""All right. Let him kill me. I didn't wish to sleep with her."" The wife told her husband, ""If you wish to kill me, all right. If you kill your nephew, I'll die with him. It is better if I and his child within me die with him."" But he wished to kill only his nephew. The woman went to her husband's sister and told all, asking her to tell her husband, Tlawah, Tihget's father, so he could plan to save his son. The next day Tlawah said to his wife, ""We had better leave this country."" They agreed to go to the north. She wanted to. (They were living at K[unknown]ad[unknown]ukhuka'h on Kanaganut Island.) Tihget no longer slept in the house but hid himself. Tlawah called together all the Ganaxadi men who were married to Tekwedih women. He said he wanted to move away to prevent war between the two clans, and to save his son. He asked the Ganaxadi if they wanted to war on their own ""children,"" the Tekwedih. They answered ""no."" They agreed to take their wives and children and to go away themselves. Near Ketchikan is a humpback-salmon creek called Ana'n, owned by the Tekwedih. Tlawah went where the Ganaxadi had fishing camps, while Yetlcanih and his group went to Anan. Later he went to the Ganaxadi camp, because his wife was soon to have her child and he came to kill his nephew. It was night and high tide. Tlawah and his group secretly packed their things in canoes and hid them. In the morning it was foggy and they started out, singing a song called k[unknown]atna'wustakihc[unknown]i'h (moving away our clan). Then Yetleanih called all the remaining people together on the beach and wept. He was sorry for what he had done. Tlawah and his group sang ""akanitlkuk[unknown]atl'n"" (my land nevermore I'll see) as they went. Tihget stood in the bow of the canoe and faced out to sea, for he didn't wish to see his uncle. As the tide came in, the current took the canoe to the north. They didn't paddle. But Yetlcanih stood at the beach and let the tide reach to his waist. He was going to allow himself to drown because his wife was the cause of his losing his nephew and his father's people.

With respect to gender, there were almost four times as many males as females among the forty-three suicides (although over the past eighteen months as many girls and women have taken their own lives as have boys and young men).

Additional individual characteristics were identified by Ward and Fox who did a ""social autopsy"" following a cluster of eight suicides on Manitoulin Island. ""They were vulnerable individuals who had negative self-esteem, were socially isolated, tended to internalize feelings and conflicts and thus were over dependent on their families"" (1977:425).
